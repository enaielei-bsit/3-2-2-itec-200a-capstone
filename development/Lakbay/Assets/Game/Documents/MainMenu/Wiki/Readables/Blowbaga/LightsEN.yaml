    <space=2em>Keep your lights clear of dirt. Use of LED or HID (high-intensity
    discharge) lamps for headlights and tail lights is allowed as long as it
    adheres to the parameters set by authorities. Check the directional and
    brake lights before the trip. If possible, switch to low beam lights if you
    are within 200 meters of the car in front of you.
