    <space=2em>When making a turn on a green signal, remember that the pedestrian crossing on the green signal have the right of way. Be sure that you do not block the traffic.

    <space=2em>When a flashing left or right green arrow together with a green signal is used, it permits the vehicle facing that signal to turn left, turn right or go through while opposing traffic faces a red signal.

    <space=4em><b>PROPER BRAKING</b>

    <space=2em>Avoid tail gaiting. Staying too close to the vehicle in front of you leaves no room to maneuver whenever there is an unnecessary traffic on your lane.

    <space=2em>Maintain a safe distance when following a vehicle. This will give you adequate space, time to react and to stop safely if necessary.

    <space=2em>Give motorcycles the same distance you would give to any other vehicle. Motorcycles are entitled to the same full length and width as all other vehicle on the road.

    <space=4em><b>FOLLOWING DISTANCE</b>

    <space=2em>Follow the two or three second rule…

    <space=2em>It is very important to avoid following another car too closely, as it gives you less time to react if the driver in front of you decides to brake or turn suddenly. For safety, drivers are advised to maintain a distance of two or three seconds of the car in front. The rule varies on the weight/mass of the vehicle given the same speed. The higher the mass, the longer the time.
    
    <space=2em>The distance is measured in time rather than meter (or other units of measurement) as it can be difficult to judge distances while driving and what counts as a safe distance varies depending on speed.
