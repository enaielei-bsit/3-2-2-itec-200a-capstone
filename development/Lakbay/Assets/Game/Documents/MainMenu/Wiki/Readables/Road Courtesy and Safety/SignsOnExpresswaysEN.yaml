    <space=2em>•  Keep adequate space with the long/large vehicles. Drivers need
    to be extra cautious when approaching and passing such vehicle. Do not pass
    the vehicle unless there is enough time and distance to complete the pass
    safely.


    <space=2em>•  Leave extra space if going uphill and stopping behind a large
    vehicle. There is a tendency that it may roll back when the driver releases
    the brakes.


    <space=2em>•  Never pass a hauling truck that is turning left or right off
    the highway. Cargo may block all or some of the lanes.
