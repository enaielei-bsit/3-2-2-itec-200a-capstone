    <space=4em> Drivers should give way to pedestrians at crossings, pavements and intersections. Drivers should slow down where there is a high amount of pedestrian activity and remember that older pedestrians and those with disabilities may need extra time to cross a road. Do not overtake at pedestrian lanes. Do not stop at pedestrian lane.

    <space=4em> Drivers must be alert on passing motorcyclists/cyclists, by always checking what is in front of their vehicle, behind it and to each side. Always leave plenty of room if overtaking a motorcyclist. Check first if there is cyclists/motorcyclists before opening your car to avoid damage hurting yourself and/or hurt the cyclists. Give way to their designated lane.
