    <space=4em>How to avoid collision with vehicles ahead:


    <space=2em><b>Stay back.</b> When conditions are unfavorable, increase the
    number of second of distance between you and the vehicle ahead.


    <space=2em><b>The Two-second / Three-second rule.</b> Use the two-or-more
    second rule to establish the necessary distance between you and the vehicle
    ahead. When the rear bumper of the vehicle ahead of you passes a stationary
    marker, count "one thousand and one, one thousand and two". The moment you
    finish counting should be the time you reach the maker. You are too close
    when you pass the marker before you finish counting.


    <space=2em><b>Stay alert.</b> Watch for signal or signs of the driver's
    intensions.


    <space=4em><b>Start stopping sooner.</b> Delayed braking leads to panic
    stops, something you would not want to happen.

    <space=4em>Most intersection collision occur because drivers fail to follow
    the right-of-way regulations.


    <space=2em><b>At an Intersection.</b> Where there is no traffic sign or
    signal the vehicle on the left shall yield to the vehicle on the right.


    <space=2em><b>At a give-way sign Intersection.</b> When you approach such a
    sign at an intersection, you must give the right-of-way to any other vehicle
    in or closely approaching the intersection.


    <space=2em><b>At a STOP sign Intersection.</b> Vehicle approaching such sign
    must come to a full stop and yield the right-of-way to vehicle in or
    approaching the intersection. If two vehicles stop at sign the same time,
    the vehicle on the left must yield to the vehicle on the right.


    <space=2em><b>At an intersection with a traffic control device. </b> If your
    light is green, you may proceed but only after yielding to other vehicle and
    pedestrians lawfully within the intersection. On intersection allowing a
    right turn on red light, proceed only after stopping and yielding to
    pedestrian and to cross-traffic vehicle. Never do a rolling stop.
