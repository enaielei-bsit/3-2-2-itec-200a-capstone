- >-

    <space=2em>Abnormal wear on either sides of the tire requires wheel
    alignment, camber alignment or caster alignment or worn kingpin


    <space=2em>Camber Angle - the measure in degrees of the difference between
    the wheels vertical alignment perpendicular to the surface. If a wheel is
    perfectly perpendicular to the surface, its camber would be 0 degrees.


    <space=2em>Caster - The angle created by the steering's pivot point from the
    front to back of the vehicle. Caster is positive if the line is angled
    forward, and negative if backward.


    <space=2em>Wheel Alignment (Toe in or toe out) - If the tires are pointed
    inward or outward, they will scrub against the surface of the road and cause
    wear along the edges. Sometimes however, tread life can be sacrificed for
    performance or stability.


    <space=2em>Kingpin - heavy vehicles with worn out kingpin may damage the
    tires and will not reach half of expected tire life.

- >-

    <space=2em>• Under inflated or over inflated tire pressures will severely
    affect the vehicle's performance in terms of tire consumption, fuel
    consumption, braking performance and driving at a high speed.


    <space=2em>• Do not buy expired "brand new" tires. Generally, brand new
    tires must be used within five  (5) years of manufactured date.


    <space=2em>• Always check load capacity of the tire and never check tire
    pressure when hot.


    <space=2em>• Stick to the tire specification of the motor vehicle. Consult
    tire professionals before upgrading your tire sizes.


    <space=2em>• Never drive with a flat tire, and if possible, always bring a
    portable air compressor.


    <space=2em>• Avoid curbing and drive carefully whenever passing an uneven
    road.
