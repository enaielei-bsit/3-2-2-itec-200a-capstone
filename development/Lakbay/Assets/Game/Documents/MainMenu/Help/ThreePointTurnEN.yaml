        The player needs to perform a Y-turn and parked in a relatively narrow street in a Y-position maneuver.
        
        This mission is pre-requisite to the next one so, the player cannot proceed to the next mission without completing the Three-Point turn.
        
        There will be a "?" that you can toggle to display hint/instructions about the mission.
        
        There will be a Pause Button which halts the progression of the game and summons a menu for the gameplay.
        
        The Key for buckling up must be press first for the car to be able to start.
        
        The Green arrow will guide the player to the exact location where it has to park.
