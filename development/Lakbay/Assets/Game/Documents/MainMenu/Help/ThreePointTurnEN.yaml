    Three-point Turn


    The player will do a U-turn in a relatively narrow street with three maneuvers. 
    
    Steps in Entering Angle Parking Space:
        1. Start with the initial position and move closer to the curve as the road is too narrow for the car to move. Turn the steering wheel to the left and drive as far as possible.
        2. Turn the steering wheel to the right and move in reverse as far as possible.
        3. Turn the steering wheel to the left again ad finish the maneuver.
