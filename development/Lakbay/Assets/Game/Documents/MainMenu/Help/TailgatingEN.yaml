    Tailgating


    In tailgating, the player will need to drive the car not too close to other vehicles to avoid failgaiting.

    To avoid “fail” gating zone, ease up and follow the three-second rule:
        1. Pick a landmark.
        2. Wait until the back of the car in front of you passes it.
        3. Then count. Starting from “1 thousand-one, 1 thousand-two, 1 thousand-three”. If you pass the landmark in less than 3 seconds, you are “fail” gating.
