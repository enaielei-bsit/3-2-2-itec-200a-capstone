    Back-in Angle Parking


    In this mission, the player needs to park the vehicles aligned at an angle.

    Steps in Entering Angle Parking Space:
        1. Check for traffic in the inside rear-view mirror signal to move right, 
        position your vehicle at least 6 feet from the rear of the parked 
        vehicles just before you enter the parking space.
        2. Begin to turn right when the front window post of your vehicle is inline 
        with the left rear of your car on your right.
        3. Turn the steering wheel slowly to the left to clear cars A and B. 
        touch the curve gently with your right front tire.
